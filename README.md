# Movie-DB

For this project, I designed and developed a fully responsive movie website that allows users to explore and discover information about movies using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the TMDB API. The goal was to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform that showcases movie details while adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
